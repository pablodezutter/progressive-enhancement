<h2>The story</h2>
<br>
<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.</p>
<p>That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.</p>
<p>They said: <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q></p>
<p>The farmer said:<q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q></p>
<p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said:
<q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
 The farmer again said: <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q></p>
<br>
<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.</p>
<p> The neighbors then said: <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded: <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q></p>
<p> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.</p>
<p>Again all the neighbors came around and said: <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q>
Again, he said: <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q></p>
<br>
<p><blockquote>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.<blockquote></p>
