<h2>The story</h2>
<br>
<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.</p>
<p>That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.</p>
<p>They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away.</p>
<p>This is most unfortunate.”</p> 
<p>The farmer said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong></p>
<p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky.</p>
<p> What a great turn of events.</p>
<p> You now have eight horses!”</p>
<p> The farmer again said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong></p> 
<br>
<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.</p>
<p> The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong></p>
<p> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.</p>
<p> Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!”</p>
<p> Again, he said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong></p>
<br>
<p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>
